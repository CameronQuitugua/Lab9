# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

For Lab 9 we demonstrated utilizing JavaScript to implement a level of interactiveness to our website whish includes updating certain items on screen when interacting with the keyboard, colliding with other items on screen, and update the 'count' when certain things are changed. ie balls collide. 

## Sources and Credits

TODO: You must credit the sources and authors of any code, libraries, or other
assets you use in your project. If you leave this section blank, your project
will be considered in violation of the Academic Honesty policy unless you truly
created everything from scratch with no outside help. If you need to use a
source that you cannot credit (e.g. a classmate's work), you must get explicit
permission from your instructor.

A simple bulleted list below is sufficient. For example:

- Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/
- jQuery: https://jquery.com/
- Background image: https://unsplash.com/photos/...
- Sound effects: https://freesound.org/people/...
- Icons: https://fontawesome.com/
- Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/
- etc.
